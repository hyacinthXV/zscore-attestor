# zScore AVS Attestor 

## Setting up as an Operator with the AVS
Guidelines to set yourself up as an operator and start the service are here - coming soon

## ▶️ Run an Attestor Node
We provide a docker-compose configuration which sets up the Attestor Node

To set up the environment, create a `.env` file with the usual zScore
configurations (see the `.env.example`), then run:

```console
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
